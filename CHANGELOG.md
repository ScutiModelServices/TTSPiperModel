# Changelog

## Unreleased

- A local run now loads `.env` from the service folder at start (python-dotenv, same as the tool services); a real environment variable still wins, and Docker is unchanged because `.env` is not in the image.
- Untracked folders now start with `.` or `_`: `zip_versions/` is `_zip_versions/`. A local `voices`, `tem_code` or `zip_versions` folder from an older checkout needs renaming by hand.
- `run.bat` is now a menu (run the service, deploy, build the release ZIP) and `run.bat run|deploy|zip` skips it. `tools/deploy.bat`, `tools/make_zip.bat` and `tools/deploy.local.example.bat` are gone; the local deploy target is `tools/deploy.local.ini` (copy `tools/deploy.local.example.ini`).
- Admin page: **Connect to this service** card with the addresses other services can use (this page's address, same PC, Docker network, `host.docker.internal`) and every endpoint, each with a Copy button.
- Admin **Try it** panel: descriptor-driven public API requests, live text streams, JSON/media output, status and latency, cancellation and redacted curl. Auth choice (b): pasted public token stays in memory; normal scope, limits and caches apply. Shared `web/playground.js` is copied across all model and tool services.

- `run.bat`: runs `uv sync` directly; `python -m uv` failed when uv was installed only as a program (winget).
- Docker: `.dockerignore` keeps `.git`, `.venv`, tests and local state out of the build context (the same file in every model service).
- Docs: set CPU threads to the number of physical cores, not logical CPUs.
- `/metrics` also returns `ttspiper_request_seconds`, a histogram of how long `/v1` calls took on that replica.

- Answer cache: the last answers for the same text, voice and speed are sent again without speaking (`TTSPIPER_CACHE_SIZE`, default 64, 0 = off; `X-Cache` header).
- `POST /v1/speak` accepts `"stream": true`: the WAV is sent sentence by sentence, so the first audio arrives sooner.
- `tools/bench.py` varies the speed per run (to skip the cache) and has `--stream`.
- First version: Piper text to speech (default voice `en_US-lessac-medium`) served on the CPU, with the admin page, tokens (scope, rate limit, expiry), metrics,
  Settings card, update checks and file downloads shared with the other model services.
- `POST /v1/speak` takes `text`, `voice` and `speed` and returns a WAV file. `GET /v1/voices` lists the voices.
- `tools/bench.py` times a service so `TTSPiperModel` and `TTSParadeeModel` can be compared.
